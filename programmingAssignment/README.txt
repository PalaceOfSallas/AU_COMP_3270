PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting. 
I did not copy whole or parts of it from another student 
or have another person write the code for me. 
Any code I am reusing in my program is clearly marked as such 
with its source clearly identified in comments.

This assignment contains the following files:
- README.txt (this)
- MSCS.java
- MSCS.class
- phw_input.txt
- stephensallas_phw_input.txt
- Programming_Assignment.pdf

This project was written in Java using the JGRASP compiler and debugger.
The only stipulation for this program (MSCS.Java) to compile is that a file 
named "phw_input.txt" must be in the same folder. This code generates a file
named "stephensallas_phw_input.txt" every time it is ran.
